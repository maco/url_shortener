## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Ensure Elixir 1.11 or higher is installed.
- Ensure Postgres 10 or higher is installed.
- If your Postgres installation doesn't have a `postgres` user with password `postgres`, update the configuration in `config/dev.exs` to use the correct credentials for your system.

### Get dependencies and set up database
- `mix deps.get`
- `mix ecto.create`
- `mix ecto.migrate`

## Decisions

Some things may seem unnecessary, like a `change_url()` function, but a future use-case could involve users being able to log in and manage the short URLs they've created, changing where they point.

Slugs are set to be the first 10 characters that result from base64 encoding. That provides a bitspace of 60. A birthday collision isn't expected to occur in that bitspace until there are 1_073_741_824 entries in the database (sqrt(2^bitspace)). This seems like a good start.
