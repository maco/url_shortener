## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Ensure Elixir 1.12 is installed.
- Ensure Postgres 13 is installed.
- If your Postgres installation doesn't have a `postgres` user with password `postgres`, update the configuration in `config/dev.exs` to use the correct credentials for your system.

### Get dependencies and set up database
- `mix deps.get`
- `mix ecto.create`
- `mix ecto.migrate`

## Decisions

Some things may seem unnecessary, like a `change_url()` function, but a future use-case could involve users being able to log in and manage the short URLs they've created, changing where they point.

In that case, it might also make sense to get rid of the check that prevents the same URL being shortened twice. Perhaps it should be saved separately for different users so they can have separate usage statistics.
